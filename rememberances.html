			<p class="section-heading">A Remberance of Memorial Day</p> <!--Topic Heading-->	
			<p>	Robert P. Tristam Coffin was a native son of Harpswell, a professor of English at Bowdoin College and winner of the pulitzer Prize for Poetry.  The following is a poem from his volume called "Strange Holiness" Published by the MacMillan Company in 1936</p>
			<p class="section-heading">Memorial Day</p> <!--Topic Heading-->
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			These people, washed and in their best, who tread</br>
			These graves walk for the living, not the dead;</br>
			They go between the starred and blazing flags,</br>
			Which in a week of sunshine will be rags,</br>
			On errands that the dead, six feet below,</br>
			Would have to cross a universe to know;</br>
			There is no pity in them, only life.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			A husband leans and listens to his wife</br>
			Because his future sons are in her power.</br>
			A widow rises from her watered flower,</br>
			Full of delicious achings of her heart.</br>
			A father stands with robust thighs apart</br>
			And glows to feel how wives beside his own</br>
			Might have enjoyed the good seed he has sown</br>
			And envey his wife her lusty sons who bend</br>
			And wrestle on the grave mound of a friend.</br>
			Young men's eyes and girl's eyes meet and kiss</br>
			And plan another crowd as bright as this.</br>
			A mother in her black dress for the day</br>
			Stoops and wipes the candy stain away</br>
			On a three-year cherub full of heat</br>
			And beauty gone forever from the feet</br>
			That came to his creation beautiful</br>
			Upon the mountains.  Children tug and pull</br>
			At each other's arms and legs and smother</br>
			The tingling, rhythmed bodies of each other</br>
			With a force that travels from the sun</br>
			But cannot go six feet through earth to one</br>
			Of all who lie with crossed and useless hands.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			Everyone who walks, or runs, or stands</br>
			Among these very evident white stones</br>
			Believes no more the existence of cold bones</br>
			Than mayflies newly born believe in night,</br>
			But feed upon the holy bread of light</br>
			And turns and treads in lovliness and lust</br>
			Upon the utter fable of the dust.

			<p class="section-heading">Orrs Island Graveyard</p> <!--Topic Heading-->	
			<p>	Gertrude Robinson was a longtime resident of Orrs Island and a writer.  The following poem was written March 22, 1948.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			How gently blow the winds from off the land,</br>
			They lade the air with balsam, pine and balm,</br>
			They mingle with the breeze of yonder strand,</br>
			O're rocks and beaches where blue rpples play.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			Fair sunset hill, upon this graceful Isle,</br>
			O're looking charming stretches of the deep,</br>
			Yours is a sacred duty all the while</br>
			To guard the immortal dust that here does sleep.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			O simple field upon upon the sightly hill,</br>
			Bedecked with flowers that nature can provide;</br>
			Thy monuments and stones can but fulfil</br>
			Desires of the souls that here abide.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			I enter not upon thy sacred soil,</br>
			By any mercenary motive led;</br>
			Nor do I come thy holy soil to foil.</br>
			I come to recollect thy humble dead.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			It seems a host of kindly fisherfolk,</br>
			Whom I have known o're all the island spread;</br>
			Have laid aside the oilskin and the cloak</br>
			To sleep forever 'mid the hallowed dead.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			No more are heard the voices of these men,</br>
			Among their boats and shacks on yonder cove;</br>
			No more are seen their lobster traps again</br>
			Nor drying nets their hands so deftly wove.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			Strange faces 'pear amid yon window panes,</br>
			Strange voices call their children from the shore;</br>
			No more can I turn down the winding lane,</br>
			And hear the cheery greetings as of yore.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			Me thinks I hear their voices rise in song,</br>
			Of praise of their creator's holy name;</br>
			I seem to feel their presence, clear and strong,</br>
			I see them in the little church again.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			How fleet is time as on and on it is spent,</br>
			Some names I've read upon these stones today</br>
			Were boys and girls, their minds on books intent,</br>
			Or playing in the schoolyard 'cross the way.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			See! Now the golden sun sink in the west,</br>
			How gorgeous are the colors o're the sound!</br>
			'Twould seem the very island of the blest</br>
			Are mingled in the ecstacy profound.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			Tis eventide, o're land and sea the calm</br>
			Blends with my quiet foot-tread from this place,</br>
			I see the pilot lights they give me balm</br>
			These souls have met their pilot face to face.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			No more on stormy seas the their boats they sail,</br>
			No more on quiet bay their dories ride;</br>
			For they have heard the voice behind the vail,</br>
			"Well done ye mariner, with me abide!"
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			No more their women walk upon the beach,</br>
			With anxious faces turned toward ocean spray.</br>
			For they are long since beyond its reach.</br>
			They too have reached the port sublime for aye!
